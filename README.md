GCHQToolkit
===========

Welcome tothe GCHQ Toolkit.

This kit attempts to provide replicas of the tools used by "hackers" at the GCHQ.

For the original article about these tools and what they do, look here:

These will be free and open-source alternatives that will most likely get you on a government watchlist :)

When I was first reading over the leak, I noticed something - most of the tools that they're describing are skiddy tools that you can find on HackForums and other extremely basic hacking forums. (Who knows how much the government threw at their programmers to make these revolutionary things) I decided to recreate them, much like the NSA Playset project is doing with the NSA's technologies. (Feel free to check them out too, they're a great cause! http://www.nsaplayset.org/)

If you'd like to contribute, feel free. It's great to have company on the watchlist! :)
